This project was taken from The Odin Project 
(https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements?ref=lnav)

I learned about positioning elements on a page with HTML and CSS.

I used grid to lay out all the elements.

I styled this page in Firefox. When opening in Chrome, the layout is close, but not perfect. 

This page is somewhat responsive, but when the window gets too narrow, some elements don't line up perfectly. It looks like responsive web design will be in an upcoming project.
